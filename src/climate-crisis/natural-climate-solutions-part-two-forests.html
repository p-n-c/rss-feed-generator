Phenology - the timing of events in the lifecycle of a plant - is affected by seasonal variation, temperature, rainfall, and interaction with other species - such as pollinators and seed spreading animals - which are themselves affected by these variations.

In complex managed and unmanaged forests native trees are better adapted to available ecological niches and therefore more resilient.</p><p>Planting trees where established peatland or grassland is in place leads to an increase in emissions, in either the short, or long term.
