Organic chemistry is the study of these compounds. Those which contain only carbon and hydrogen are called hydrocarbons. Fossil fuels are hydrocarbons.</p><h3>Hydrocarbons</h3><p>Fossil fuels form when dead plants and animals decompose in the absence of oxygen and are submitted to intense heat and pressure over millions of years.</p><div><p>When hydrocarbons are burnt in air they react with oxygen to release the energy stored in their covalent bonds in the form of light and heat.</p><div class="pages_inset__I5Xhc"><span>Hydrocarbon + oxygen → carbon dioxide + water + energy (light and heat)</span><span>e.g. CH<span class="pages_sub__EXufJ">4</span> + 2O<span class="pages_sub__EXufJ">2</span> → 2H<span class="pages_sub__EXufJ">2</span>O + CO<span class="pages_sub__EXufJ">2</span> + energy</span><div><span class="Links_externalLink__wrzbB"><a href="https://energyeducation.ca/encyclopedia/Hydrocarbon_combustion">Hydrocarbon combustion</a></span></div></div></div><p>The amount of energy released depends on the bonds between atoms in a molecule.

Many of these are critical to life, including RNA, DNA, proteins, and sugars. It is this ability to bind to itself in long chains, form stable compounds with other elements and the proximity of electrons to the nucleus, that makes carbon the best, and perhaps the only, building block of life, not only on this planet, but in the universe.</p><h2 id="carbon-cycle">Fast times in the Anthropocene</h2><p>The carbon cycle regulates the flow of carbon through the earth and the atmosphere. The distribution of carbon throughout the cycle affects temperature which alters conditions on earth to which all life must adapt.</p><p>The temperature of the seas and the land has varied widely over geologic time. The main driver for the climate is the energy reaching us from the sun, a figure which varies according to the earth&#x27;s orbit and the state of the sun itself. Temperature is also affected by random events such as meteor strikes and volcanic eruptions.</p><p>When temperature and climate change slowly evolution by natural selection is possible.

The collapse of the Carboniferous rainforest - due to climate change - provided the organic matter that would later become coal.</p><p>By burning that coal, and other fossil fuels, we have begun to change the climate, and because the change is rapid, many species have not, and will not, adapt.</p><h3>Carbon emissions and reserves</h3><p>Cumulative <span class="Links_externalLink__wrzbB"><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/co2-emissions">emissions</a></span> of carbon dioxide to date are ~1.5 trillion tonnes.</p><blockquote><span>Remaining reserves in tonnes: 900 coal, 150 oil, 105 gas, 540 shale gas, etc. = 1.695 trillion.</span><div>Carbon is also found in methane hydrates in polar regions and under the seas.

Carbon has 3 isotopes, carbon-12, carbon-13, and carbon-14.</p><h4>How do we know the extra carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is caused by burning fossil fuels?</h4><p>Plants absorb less (heavy) carbon-13 from the atmosphere than (light) carbon-12, and also favour carbon-12 for photosynthesis.</p><p>Therefore when we burn fossil fuels we are releasing carbon that has relatively less carbon-13. This difference can be detected by measuring the relative ratio of carbon isotopes in the atmosphere. The isotopic signature confirms the man-made origin of current climate change.</p><p>NASA has been monitoring the natural carbon cycle using satellites for some time including<!-- --> <span class="Links_externalLink__wrzbB"><a href="https://ocov2.jpl.nasa.gov/">Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2</a></span> and<!-- --> <span class="Links_externalLink__wrzbB"><a href="https://ocov3.jpl.nasa.gov/">Orbiting Carbon Observatory-3</a></span>. Around 2025 they will launch the Copernicus CO2 Mission, the first operational carbon dioxide monitoring satellite constellation, focused on monitoring human-produced emissions.</p><h3>The sun</h3><p>The energy from fossil fuels is derived from the sun; photons absorbed by chlorophyll excite electrons and thereby enable the processes by which photosynthesis produces organic compounds.
