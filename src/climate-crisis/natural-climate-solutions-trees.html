A record of what exists and the ability to monitor the effects of climate change and land use change is key for assessing the value of the natural world, and preserving it.</p><p>There are good reasons to plant trees where there were none - afforestation - when doing so is not at the expense of healthy ecosystems, and for planting native trees, or allowing natural rewilding, where they have been lost - reforestation. In addition to planting trees, existing forests must be left intact.</p><p>The ecosystems which trees foster are critical for life, and together with other natural climate solutions such as peatland and the three main marine ecosystems - seagrass, mangroves and salt marshes - they are integral to conserving biodiversity, human health and mitigating negative aspects of climate change.</p><div><div class="Top_top__AxsLu"><div class="Top_internalLink__uD9Yo"><span class="Links_externalLink__wrzbB"><a href="#top">Back to the top of the page</a></span></div></div></div></section><section><h2>References</h2><ul class="Links_unorderedList__N44HY"><li class="Links_externalLink__wrzbB"><a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/in-depth-qa-how-trees-benefit-nature-people-and-the-climate/">In-depth Q&amp;A: How trees benefit nature, people and the climate | CarbonBrief, Orla Dwyer, </a></li><li class="Links_externalLink__wrzbB"><a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/114/44/11645">Natural climate solutions | Griscom et al.</a></li><li class="Links_externalLink__wrzbB"><a href="https://theconversation.com/there-arent-enough-trees-in-the-world-to-offset-societys-carbon-emissions-and-there-never-will-be-158181">The Conversation | There aren’t enough trees in the world | Bonnie Waring</a></li><li class="Links_externalLink__wrzbB"><a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/explainer-10-ways-negative-emissions-could-slow-climate-change">10 ways ‘negative emissions’ could slow climate change | CarbonBrief</a></li><li class="Links_externalLink__wrzbB"><a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/in-depth-experts-assess-the-feasibility-of-negative-emissions">Experts assess the feasibility of ‘negative emissions’ | CarbonBrief</a></li><li class="Links_externalLink__wrzbB"><a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/chapter/spm/">IPCC special report: global warming of 1.5ºc</a></li><li class="Links_externalLink__wrzbB"><a href="https://trilliontrees.org/home">Trillion Trees</a></li><li class="Links_externalLink__wrzbB"><a href="https://www.1t.org/">One trillion trees | World Economic Forum</a></li><li class="Links_externalLink__wrzbB"><a href="https://forestlearning.edu.au/images/resources/How%20carbon%20is%20stored%20in%20trees%20and%20wood%20products.pdf">How is carbon stored in trees and wood products?
