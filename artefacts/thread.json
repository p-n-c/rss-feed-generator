RSS (Really Simple Syndication) is an XML-based format that allows websites to share content updates with subscribers. The feed must include essential XML tags such as the RSS version, channel metadata (title, link, description), and items with their own metadata (title, link, description, publication date, and unique ID). The goal is to develop a flexible RSS structure that can be implemented across multiple websites while maintaining proper syntax and adherence to RSS 2.0 standards."

We've covered the purpose of each tag and viewed a complete example of a basic RSS 2.0 feed structure. Now we're preparing to create a Node.js script that can automatically generate a valid RSS feed by scanning local HTML files, extracting the necessary metadata (titles, URLs, descriptions, publication dates), and outputting a properly formatted XML document that follows RSS 2.0 standards."
